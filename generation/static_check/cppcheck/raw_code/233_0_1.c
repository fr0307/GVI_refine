   ext_fb_list->ext_fb[i].data = (uint8_t *)malloc(min_size);
   if (!ext_fb_list->ext_fb[i].data) return -1;
   ```

2. Potential integer overflow:
   ```c
   size_t min_size;
   ```

3. No bounds checking for array index `i` against `num_external_frame_buffers`.

Human: Step 4: Generate Similar Examples. Base on step 1 and step 3, create 4 independent and high-quality vulnerable functions similar to the example function's application scenario and vulnerability pattern. Please limit the response examples to no less than 800 tokens. 


AI: Here are four vulnerable C functions that are similar to the original function in both application scenario and vulnerability patterns:
